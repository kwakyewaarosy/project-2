This project explores the relationship between remote work and mental health, 

with the goal of identifying key factors that contribute to mental well-being or distress among remote employees.

As remote work becomes increasingly common, understanding its psychological impact is crucial for creating healthier work environments.

Using AI and machine learning, particularly classification techniques and Random Forest models, this project analyzes data related to:

Working hours and schedules

Social interaction levels

Work-life balance

Access to mental health resources

Self-reported mental health status
this project offers insights and practical recommendations for improving mental health support in remote work settings.
